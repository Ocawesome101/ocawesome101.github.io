# OC-DOS

OC-DOS is an MS-DOS clone for OpenComputers. It is not terribly feature-filled, but it runs, and it acts like DOS.

There isn't really an IO library, and `package` is under `module`.

I am slowly writing a second DOS-like operating system, DOS-API. It will implement a chunk of the DOS api calls, enabling closer simulation of actual DOS.
