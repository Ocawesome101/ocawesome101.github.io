%{*brightwhite{Some Thoughts on the Pro-Life Movement}
  I have at least two friends who are very "pro-life."

  From them, I have heard a few primary arguments:
  
    *brightwhite{1}) Women are being told that abortion is the only option if they get pregnant.  There is somehow a billion-dollar industry behind this.
    *brightwhite{2}) Abortion is a sin, because babies are living things with souls from the moment of conception.
    *brightwhite{3}) Abortion is dangerous.

  I have asked for evidence for point *brightwhite{1} multiple times and been given none.  I am generally highly skeptical of this claim.  However, let's assume for a moment that it *brightwhite{is} true.  If it's true, then the correct solution to this is not to outlaw abortion, but rather to fix the root problem of the corrupt education system.

  Now on to claim *brightwhite{2}.

  From a biological standpoint, yes, babies are living things from the moment of conception.  This is a fact.  However, a baby cannot think, cannot percieve, until much later in the pregnancy (exactly when is heavily debated and is neither here nor there).

  The way I see it, abortion should be a legal right.  It should be a woman's choice to have a pregnancy aborted, and that avenue should be open no matter what.  (Although, if the baby can survive outside of the womb, the better option is to birth it anyway and, if the mother does not want it, put it up for adoption.)  Each and every single one of the @32,000 rape-related pregnancies{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8765248/} that occurs annually in the US alone should have the option to abort - for it is a much worse thing for a woman to be forced through 9 months of pregnancy, or to desperately seek an unsafe abortion, than to have a safe option.

  As per @the World Health Organization{https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/abortion}, 45% of all abortions are unsafe.  These are   }
