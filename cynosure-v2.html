<p><span class='brightwhite'>Cynosure 2.0</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven't heard of it (let's face it, if you're on this website you probably have), I am the author and sole maintainer of one of the better Unix-like operating systems for OpenComputers - the aptly named Unix-Like Operating System.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I started development of ULOS's Cynosure kernel back in January, as I desired a better-structured operating system than either Monolith or Apotheosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;My goals included a faster VT100 emulator, a better process management system, proper permissions management, proper support for custom filesystems, and a cleaner separation between userspace and kernel space (i.e., if one so desires, one may use only the kernel and write their own userspace independent of ULOS's).&nbsp;&nbsp;The project expanded to include features such as pre-emptive multitasking, and now pulls off most of its major goals;&nbsp;&nbsp;support for custom filesystems has not been put through its paces (and likely never will be), and permissions are only half-implemented (user permissions are there, but no file permissions).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that spurred me to begin development of the next generation of Cynosure was my attempt to develop a <a href='https://luaposix.github.io/luaposix'>luaposix</a> compatibility layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;During said attempt, I realized that, while Cynosure's user-level API works well for most Lua development, it lines up very little with the more traditional C standard library on which luaposix is built.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than build such an API upon what Cynosure provides, which would most likely result in lower compatibility with some programs, I have decided to rewrite most of Cynosure into Cynosure 2.0.</p>
<p><span class='brightwhite'>Goals</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Actual native support for booting from a custom filesystem (the first to be supported is the Cynosure File System, for which I have mostly completed a driver);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; This comes with the side effect of making managed filesystems a bit of a second-class citizen.&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to support them, but it is not a priority.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; This is primarily so that file permissions are supported everywhere.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A more POSIX-like user-facing API, such that a Luaposix compatibility layer is simple;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Proper support for executable formats.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some other goals, too, but those are the primary ones.<br></p>
<p><span class='brightwhite'>Source Code</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynosure 2.0's source code is on GitHub at <a href='https://github.com/ocawesome101/cynosure-2.0'>https://github.com/ocawesome101/cynosure-2.0</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not even remotely ready for use at the time of writing.</p>
