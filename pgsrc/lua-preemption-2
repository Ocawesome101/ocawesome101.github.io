%{*brightwhite{Pre-emption 2: Electric Boogaloo}
  On *brightwhite{December 10, 2021}, I published @a writeup{./lua-preemption.html} of the pre-emption method I use in @Cynosure{https://github.com/ocawesome101/oc-cynosure}.

  While writing that article, I came across a fairly critical bug that in said article I glossed over because fixing it meant rewriting the entire code processor.  The time has come, though, and I had to write a preemption implementation for @Cynosure 2{https://github.com/ocawesome101/oc-cynosure-2}.

  The code for that is @here{https://github.com/Ocawesome101/oc-cynosure-2/blob/dev/src/scheduler/preempt.lua}.  You may follow along if you wish.

  So what's different about this new code?}
%{*brightwhite{How It Works}
  As with the previous implementation, there is a table of patterns; the primary difference is that there are more of them.  They also use Cynosure 2's randomized *code{sysyield} function name to prevent overriding the preemption bits.

  After that table there is the *code{gsub} function, which takes a chunk of code and replaces all the patterns in it.

  Then there is the *code{wrap} function.

  This function takes in a chunk of code.  It iterates through that chunk of code and finds either a quote ('") or an open bracket ([).

  When it finds a quote, it will flip the internal variable *code{in_str}.  There's some extra logic around matching up quote pairs.

  When it finds an open bracket:
    *brightwhite{-} If that open bracket is immediately followed by another one, this is the beginning of a multiline string.  It will find the closest following *code{]]} and attach that to the result string.
    *brightwhite{-} If the open bracket is followed by some number of *code{=}s and *brightwhite{then} an open bracket, it matches the balance of that and adds the result to the result string: e.g. for *code{[===[} it will find *code{]===]}and treat that as a string.
    *brightwhite{-} Otherwise, it ignores the bracket and continues.

  This logic is a little simpler than the previous implementation, and doesn't freak out over multiline strings with quotes in them.  All-in-all I think it's a much-needed improvement.

  Aside from the above stuff, everything in the previous article still applies to the original Cynosure.}
