<p><span class='brightwhite'>Abortions</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;[ the subject matter of this article is probably not relevant to those under about 12. ]<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the controversy surrounding the recent Texas Heartbeat law, I thought I'd share my opinons on the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;[note: this turned into a bit of a rant.]<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as with many things so often polarized in today's society, abortion is <span class='brightwhite'>not</span> a black-and-white issue:&nbsp;&nbsp;different people have different beliefs as to when abortion is and is not okay.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say that abortion once there is a "detectable heartbeat" (after six weeks, in the case of the Texas Heartbeat Law) is murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally believe that abortion is okay, with sufficient justification, until the baby is old enough to no longer be dependent on being inside its mother for survival (i.e. can we save it with modern nedicine with no significant side effects).&nbsp;&nbsp;This is generally true of babies about 5.5 months into pregnancy and later.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the amount of justification required goes up as the baby gets older than three or four months, if for no reason other than that if the baby is unwanted it makes more sense to abort within the first few months of pregnancy rather than, say, six months in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion should not be carried out after 24 weeks without a medical reason to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;If abortion will save the mother from death or otherwise severe consequences, then I believe that <span class='brightwhite'>if</span> the baby is not old enough to survive outside the mother, <span class='brightwhite'>or</span> surgically removing the baby / forcing birth will harm the mother, then abortion should always be carried out.&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it bluntly, saving the life of a woman whom other people love and care for should <span class='brightwhite'>always</span> take priority over saving an unborn child who has little attachment to this world.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people oppose abortion on religious grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a perfectly valid reason to oppose it as long as they do not try to force their beliefs on other people, <span class='brightwhite'>particularly through lawmaking</span> (which, sadly, happens far too often as a result of our<span class='brightwhite'>[1]</span> predominantly Christian society);&nbsp;&nbsp;remember that this is a country<span class='brightwhite'>[1]</span> where freedom of religion is an essential founding principle, and that other religions exist besides Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Judaism, for example. outlines certain circumstances under which abortion <span class='brightwhite'>must</span> take place if the mother is in danger<span class='brightwhite'>[2]</span>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first paragraph, I mentioned that some believe that abortion is immoral once a fetus has a detectable heartbeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "detectable heartbeat" varies <span class='brightwhite'>wildly</span> from place-to-place, with some saying that it is detectable at six weeks and others that it is much later.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not informed enough to make a decision here.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with the Texas Heartbeat Law's $10,000 fine for assistance with abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine like this is a slap on the wrist for someone well-to-do and devastating for those less so.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the latter group is more likely to be subject to accidental pregnancies, thus requiring birth control more (whether through abortion or other means).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I would like to make is that America's sex education is a complete piece of <span class='brightwhite'>[REDACTED]</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all parents are comfortable with giving their kids "the talk" -- some would rather their children not know the details, even into said children's late adolescence.&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves teens to either be left in the dark completely or be misinformed by their peers (no, babies are <span class='brightwhite'>not</span> made when people kiss), both of which lead to more accidental pregnancies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore make the case that education is key.&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, <span class='brightwhite'>education is key</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more educated people, especially teenagers, are regarding the details of procreation, the <span class='brightwhite'>fewer</span> accidental pregnancies will happen, thus lowering the number of abortions necessary.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary solution to this problem is in my mind a compulsory sex ed curriculum for <span class='brightwhite'>all</span> students in <span class='brightwhite'>all</span> schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal curriculum for this would include details on protection, birth control pills (not necessarily abortion pills), probably menstrual cycles (I do not and indeed cannot speak for everyone, but I personally would definitely panic if I started bleeding from my reproductive orifices with no knowledge of why it was happening!), and most importantly how babies are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going into extreme detail is not necessary;&nbsp;&nbsp;a simple "A male's reproductive organs enter a female's, and babies are created as a result of the male ejaculating" should suffice.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some excellent books on this topic, <span class='brightwhite'>It's Not The Stork!</span>, <span class='brightwhite'>It's So Amazing</span>, and <span class='brightwhite'>It's Perfectly Normal</span>, all three by Robie Harris, and respectively for young children, late-elementary school children, and middle-to-high-school adolescents.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, if you feel religiously obligated to force your beliefs on abortion on others, I beg you to reconsider.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to force my beliefs on others through this article, but merely to share them for the purpose of discussion, and hopefully to provide a rational voice on the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also propose a better sex ed plan for schools going forward, particularly education on protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not only increase awareness among adolescents but also reduce accidental pregnancies, therefore reducing the number of abortions desired nationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose this as a silver bullet -- the issue is much more complex than just a lack of sex ed -- but it is certainly an improvement over our current system.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocawesome101<br><br></p>
