  Hi there, hello, it's me, Ocawesome101.

  Join @my Discord guild{https://discord.gg/fMBMqTGGXB} if you want.

  I'm moderately fine at piano.  @Sometimes I compose things{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2fW_Gae4kQ}.

  I write way too much Lua.  Sometimes I dabble in other languages, like C.  Some projects I'm particularly proud of are @Recrafted{https://ocawesome101.github.io/recrafted}, @the FC-1{https://github.com/Ocawesome101/cpu-related-things/tree/master/fc1}, @ULOS 2{https://github.com/oc-ulos}, and @TLE{https://github.com/ocawesome101/tle}.}
