<p><span class='brightwhite'>Some Thoughts on the Pro-Life Movement</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have at least two friends who are very "pro-life."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;From them, I have heard a few primary arguments:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='brightwhite'>1</span>) Women are being told that abortion is the only option if they get pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is somehow a billion-dollar industry behind this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='brightwhite'>2</span>) Abortion is a sin, because babies are living things with souls from the moment of conception.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='brightwhite'>3</span>) Abortion is dangerous.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for evidence for point <span class='brightwhite'>1</span> multiple times and been given none.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am generally highly skeptical of this claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let's assume for a moment that it <span class='brightwhite'>is</span> true.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's true, then the correct solution to this is not to outlaw abortion, but rather to fix the root problem of the corrupt education system.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on to claim <span class='brightwhite'>2</span>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;From a biological standpoint, yes, babies are living things from the moment of conception.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fact.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a baby cannot think, cannot percieve, until much later in the pregnancy (exactly when is heavily debated and is neither here nor there).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I see it, abortion should be a legal right.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be a woman's choice to have a pregnancy aborted, and that avenue should be open no matter what.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Although, if the baby can survive outside of the womb, the better option is to birth it anyway and, if the mother does not want it, put it up for adoption.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each and every single one of the <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8765248/'>32,000 rape-related pregnancies</a> that occurs annually in the US alone should have the option to abort - for it is a much worse thing for a woman to be forced through 9 months of pregnancy, or to desperately seek an unsafe abortion, than to have a safe option.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As per <a href='https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/abortion'>the World Health Organization</a>, 45% of all abortions are unsafe.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
